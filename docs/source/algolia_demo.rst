Part 1 (3 hours)


[ ] Choose a dataset,
either from our list of public datasets: https://github.com/algolia/datasets
or you can go ahead and use your own from a different source if you'd like!


[ ] Create an Algolia account
[ ] index the data: https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/indexing/indexing-overview/#overview
You can do so via the API or dashboard, whichever you prefer.

[ ] Configure the basic relevance settings for the data (again, using the dashboard or API):
https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/the-implementation-process/#configuring-relevance



[ ] Build out a basic search user interface, taking care to ensure for a good user experience.
Use this as an opportunity to be as creative as you would like!
Feel free to use one of our 4 InstantSearch libraries if these will ease your development: https://community.algolia.com/#instantsearch

[ ] Add your code to a publicly accessible Github repo
and then publish it using Github's gh-pages so we can interact with it!



[ ] Give Algolia admins access to your data so we can view your relevance settings:
https://www.algolia.com/users/access_control


[ ] Write up a few paragraphs outlining your project,
[ ] what you intended to accomplish,
and any feedback for Algolia you have and
[ ] add these to a README.
